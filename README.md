## PROSPER LOAN ANALYSIS----DATA VISUALIZATION
Data Visualization using Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn

## The Dataset
The dataset is a loan dataset originally from kaggle. it is called the prosper loan dataset. It belongs to a San Francisco based company that is involved in peer-to-peer lending. The dataset consists of 113,937 loans with over 81 variables on each loan. Some of the variables include;

Loan Amount: This is the original/initial amount of loan taken.

Borrower Rate or Interest Rate: is the borrower's interest rate for the loan.

Current loan status: This indicates the current status of the loan.

Borrower APR: The borrowe's annual percentage rate from the loan.

Listing Creation Date: The date the listing was created.

These are a few of the variables present in this dataset. I'll be performing exploratory data analysis on this dataset to predict patterns and trends and to detect relationships bewteen the variables.

## Summary of the Findings.
After Part I exploration analysis, below are the conclusions of my observation;

1. California is the city with the highest number of borrower's.
2. A larger percentage of the borrower's are gainfully employed.
3. The ratio of home owners to non-home owners amongst the borrowers is evenly distributed. i.e 50:50.
4. Most of the loans taken have a term of 36 months.
5. Home owners have a higher possibility of accessing a loan regardless of their employment status.
6. The distribution of the debt to income ratio is relatively low.
7.  There is a relationship between Income range and Loan amount as there is a consistent increase in the mean and percentile as income range increases.

## key Insights for Presentation.
The key insights of my presentation after my exploration analysis are as follows
1.  The demography of the borrowers.
2.  The ratio of homeowners to non home owners amongst the borrowers.
3.  The distribution of income range among the borrowers.
4.  Relationship between income range owning a house.


## Limitations.
While exploratory data analysis is a good way to know the data using interesting and vivid visualizations, in order to be able to make a final statement about the relationship amongst the variables, one would need to conduct statistical tests and build predictive models.
